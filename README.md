# ANN-Stock-Price-Predictor

The stock market is more volatile than ever. In an attempt to capture and analyze these movements, I have developed an ANN Stock Price Predictor. This Flask application allows users to select a stock and a visualization based on historical closing prices and my predictions based on a new 70/30 train-test split. There will also be an NLP component which allows users to upload or extract text data from Twitter's API as supporting attributes for the model (work in progress).
